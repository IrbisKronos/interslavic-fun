All Slavic languages are treated equally, although it cannot be avoided that a Slavic interlanguage is closer to \u201emiddle-of-the-road\u201c languages like Slovak or Rusyn than to peripheral languages like Sorbian or Macedonian. Interslavic is explicitly not meant to be \u201emore Slavic than the Slavs\u201c by purifying it from foreign influences, even though a language based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages will automatically eliminate many local (non-Slavic) influences anyway. There is, however, no reason to exclude international vocabulary, provided that it can be recognised by all, or at least most, Slavic speakers.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"introduction/faq":{"id":"introduction/faq","title":"Frequently asked questions","description":"How to learn and use Interslavic?","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"introduction/history":{"id":"introduction/history","title":"History of Interslavic","description":"The history of the Interslavic language is closely connected with Pan-Slavism, an ideology that believes that the Slavs are one nation and aims at their cultural and political unification.
